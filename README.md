# PRIMAL RING
An odd 2D space-platform adventure!

Abduction! You're suddenly on a strange, technological building. Wait... it's a space ship! How? When? That's impossible!
You can't even go on a boat because of you getting ill from the waves. And now, you're in space.

In addition, the voices from the speakers command you to travel to a set of planets in their place. "You are the most disposable
being in this station for the task.", they said. They're truly kind people.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this adventure, you'll have the duty of travel across the Primal Solar System looking for strange, poweful mineral shards
required by your captors. Beware! These planets are wild and unknown, but no one asserts they are deserted...

Besides, can you trust on your misterious captors? They've never shown themselves, so you didn't even know if they are humans
or another kind of creature. They seem to be too much shy for those who have captured you.

Go, face the duty! Stay alive!

## RESOURCES

I've included a text file in which I've detailed my font and sound external
resources for the game. Although I'm not including those external files into
the repository (those what I include are created on my own), I want to guide
others in order to allow them add effects easily.
