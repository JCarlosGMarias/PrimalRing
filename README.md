# SpaceQuest
An odd 2D space-platform adventure!

Abduction! You're suddenly on a strange, technological building. Wait... it's a space ship! How? When? That's impossible!
You can't even go on a boat because of you getting ill from the waves. And now, you're in space.

In addition, the voices from the speakers command you to travel to a set of planets in their place. "You are the most disposable
being in this station for the task.", they said. They're truly kind people.
